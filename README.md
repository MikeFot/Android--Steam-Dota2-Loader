# Steam Data Loader
Java library for downloading data from Steam using the provided APIs.

The project is currently in progress but feel free to use it. If you do, let me know so I can include a link to your app in the description for others to find!

It is updated regularly as I am documenting the APIs. Most of the models and classes have Javadocs, along with links to the wiki pages.

## Usage
Instantiate a SteamLoader and use it to get Provider wrapper classes or the APIs directly. You will also need a Steam API key which you can get from the Steam Community website. Happy coding!

## Live Sample

## Contribution / Attribution
- Feel free to submit PRs, as long as you keep the project pure Java. Android code will not be merged in.
- If you do use the library in a project, please let me know. I would be happy to get some feedback and I will put a link to your project here!
